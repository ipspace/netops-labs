# Building Network Automation Solutions

Networking engineers attending the [Building Network Automation Solutions](https://www.ipspace.net/NetAutSol/) online course had to solve several hands-on assignments, including:

* [Build Your Own Network Automation Lab](EX-Build_Lab.md)
* [Easy Wins: Create Summary Reports](EX-Create_Summary_Reports.md)
* [Data Models: Create a Service Data Model](EX-Create_Service_Data_Model.md)
* [Deploy Network Services From a Data Model](EX-Deploy_Network_Services.md)
* [Logging, Validation, and Testing](EX-Logging_Testing.md)

I reviewed every single solution submitted by the course attendees. I can't do the same for everyone else, but you might still want to try to solve at least some of the challenges.
